# Master-Internship
The is the report and the presentation of the work I did during my R&amp;D internship at Iktos (Paris) for my Master's 2 internship at the Institut Polytechnique de Paris (Affiliated school : Ecole Polytechnique)

The whole objective of the internship was the creation of a 3D Molecule Generation Model Targeting a Protein of Interest.

In order to do so Graph Neural Networks were used, with a discussion around equivariance, invariance etc...
